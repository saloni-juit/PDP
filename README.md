For running this code : 
In the folder, Lowe :
run : 
1) npm install
2) bower install
3) run grunt serve command

These steps will run the code on the http://localhost:9000/

For circumventing the CORS error :
I used a public proxy : http://cors-proxy.htmldriven.com/ and routed all my calls through this to get the data from the Lowe server.
